# OpenFaceFrameDropTools
These executable tools are designed to detect any frames of false valid facial recognition caused by secondary face detection. Executables for Single and Multi-Face Detection are included.

These executables require the MATLAB Runtime 9.5 (R2018b) to be installed on your machine. You can find the installer for it here:
